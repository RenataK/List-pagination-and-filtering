# List-pagination-and-filtering

In this project, you'll find the use of a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

Starting with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses:
  write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time 
  add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

Using the principle of "progressive enhancement", the page displays the students' names without JavaScript turned on, (but is much improved/enhanced with the JavaScript programming added) 
to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript is required to use the web page.
